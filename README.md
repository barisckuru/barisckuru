Currently working on my master thesis project: ✍🏽
- modelling entorhinal grid cell outputs
- obtaining population rate code and phase code
- feeding grid cell outputs to a biophysically realistic dentate gyrus
- observing the effect of pattern separation on grid cell codes
- investigating role of inhibition in dentate gyrus on pattern separation
- comparing the efficacy of rate, phase and complex(rate&phase) codes by a perceptron
* with @grid_cell and @pyDentate repositories

Interested in: 👁
- computational dynamics of memory encoding-recalling in the brain
- mechanisms for information transfer in the brain
- function of neural oscillations
- role of inhibitory interneurons
- recurrent neural networks
- human - machine interfaces
