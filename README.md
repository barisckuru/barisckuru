**barisckuru/barisckuru** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Currently working on my master's thesis project on: ✍🏽
- modelling entorhinal grid cell outputs
- obtaining population rate code and phase code
- integrating grid cell outputs to a biophysically realistic dentate gyrus
- investigating the effect of pattern separation on grid cell phase and rate coding
- investigating role of inhibition in dentate gyrus on pattern separation
- assessing the efficacy of rate, phase and complex(rate&phase) codes by a perceptron

further @grid_cell and @pyDentate repositories on github

Interested in: 👁
- computational dynamics of memory encoding, storage and retrieval in the brain
- mechanisms for information transfer in the brain
- function of neural oscillations
- role of inhibitory interneurons
- recurrent neural networks
- human - machine interfaces
