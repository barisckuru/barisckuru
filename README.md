--> I am currently working on my master thesis project on:
- modelling entorhinal grid cell outputs
- obtaining population rate code and phase code
- feeding grid cell outputs to a biophysically realistic dentate gyrus
- observing the effect of pattern separation on grid cell codes
- investigating role of inhibition in dentate gyrus on pattern separation
- comparing the efficacy of rate, phase and complex(rate&phase) codes by a perceptron
